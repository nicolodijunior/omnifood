# README OF Omnifood

This website is part of the final modules of the course "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS". The course is avaiable on Udemy and was created by Jonas Schmedtmann. The website is a fictional company called Omnifood, which delivers healthy food to your door. The website is fully responsive and was built using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.

## The course  
The course is focused in CSS3 and HTML5, but also covers some jQuery and responsive design. The course is divided in 9 modules, and this page is coded in the last 3. Different from the other projects, this code is not developed by me, I just **followed the steps of the instructor, copying it's code during the classes**, learning the course content. The course is avaiable on Udemy and can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/learn/v4/overview).
